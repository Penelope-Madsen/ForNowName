# StarGazers
## Project Description
My project is based off the game [Reigns: Her Majesty](https://store.steampowered.com/app/717640/Reigns_Her_Majesty/). The user is presented with a card that generally has a question and then they can choose between two options which affect their levels. In Reigns, these levels are the church, the people, the army, and the treasury, but this game will be set on a spaceship and will instead use fuel, crew moral, cargo, and a fourth thing. They will die if one of the levels gets too low or too high: too much fuel and the ship explodes, too little and it can't go anywhere, too much moral and the crew overthrows you, too little and they stop working, too much cargo and the ship overflows, too little and you won't make any money, etc. Cards appear in mostly random order, but can be influenced by choices made in previous cards. Cards might include specific events, members of your crew, or enemy ships.
This project uses pygame to create graphics and is coded in python.
